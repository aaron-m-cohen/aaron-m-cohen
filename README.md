### Aaron's Github

I am a student in BloomTech's Backend Development program currently located in Seattle, WA. 

I have experience at a hedge fund, in digital construction, and in bookselling.

In addition to working as a software engineer, I have received a Master of Arts in Creative Writing from Southern Miss, where I won multiple departmental awards for my fiction.

When I am not writing software, I'm usually reading a book, writing fiction or poetry, playing strategy games (board, card or video all work in my book), or watching one of Seattle's many sports teams. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
* Java
* Spring Boot
* AWS (Lambda, DynamoDb, API Gateway and CloudFormation so far)
* React

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
* Projects for BloomTech's curriculum, including a "Goodreads for Video Games" clone.

* I have future plans to work on a web-based text editor designed to help writers with [Constrained Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing). 

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
* Why Math and Computer Science and creative writing aren't as different as you'd think
* Experimental programming languages or literature (and why they serve a similar purpose in the culture)
* Seattle Sports

## ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
* firstname + b94 at gmail dot com
* Email me for my IRL address and send me a postcard! Nothing better than something other than junk in the mailbox.
